            <!-- Question1 -->
            <div class="qitem">
                <p class="question">How does the virus spread?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="aitem">
                <p class="answer">The virus that causes COVID-19 most commonly spreads between people who 
                    are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet, or 2 arm 
                    lengths) It spreads through respiratory droplets or small particles, such 
                    as those in aerosols, produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, 
                    sings, talks, or breathes.</p>
                   
            </div>  

            <!-- Question2 -->    
            <div class="qitem">
                <p class="question">Will warm weather stop the outbreak of Covid-19?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="aitem">
                <p class="answer">It is not yet known whether weather and temperature affect 
                    the spread of COVID-19. Some other viruses, like those that cause the
                    common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that 
                    does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses 
                    during other months.  There is much more to learn about the
                    transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with 
                    COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing.</p>

            <!-- Question3 -->
            <div class="qitem">
                    <p class="question">What is community spread?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="aitem">
                <p class="answer">Community spread means people have been infected with 
                    the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where 
                    they became infected. Each health department determines community 
                    spread differently based on local conditions. For information on 
                    community spread in your area, please visit your health department’s 
                    website.​</p>

            <!-- Question4 -->
            <div class="qitem">
                <p class="question">Can mosquitoes or ticks spread corona virus?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="aitem">
                <p class="answer">At this time, CDC has no data to suggest that this 
                    new coronavirus or other similar coronaviruses are spread by 
                    mosquitoes or ticks. The main way that COVID-19 spreads is from 
                    person to person. See How Coronavirus Spreads for more 
                    information.</p>

            <!-- Question5 -->
            <div class="qitem">
                <p class="question">Am i at risk for COVID-19 from malls,packages
                    or products?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="aitem">
                <p class="answer">There is still a lot that is unknown about 
                    COVID-19 and how it spreads. Coronaviruses are thought to be 
                    spread most often by respiratory droplets. Although the 
                    virus can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it 
                    is unlikely to be spread from domestic or international 
                    mail, products or packaging. However, it may be possible 
                    that people can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or 
                    object that has the virus on it and then touching their 
                    own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not 
                    thought to be the main way the virus spreads.</p>

            <!-- Question6 -->
            <div class="qitem">
                <p class="question">Is it possible to have FLUE and COVID-19 at the same time?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="aitem">
                <p class="answer">Yes. It is possible to test positive for 
                    flu (as well as other respiratory infections) and 
                    COVID-19 at the same time.</p>                    
            </div>

            <!-- Question7 -->
            <div class="qitem">
                <p class="question">When should i seek emergency care if i have COVID-19?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="aitem">
                <p class="answer">Look for emergency warning signs* for
                    COVID-19. If someone is showing any of these signs,
                    seek emergency medical care immediately</p>
